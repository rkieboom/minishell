some issues we found : Command not found error code should be 127       [done]
 ˆC should not show up when ctrl-Cing on empty line.					[Fixed by doing] = "stty -echoctl"
 cd does not check for directory.										[done]
 This test case: "< Makefile cat | wc -l > outfile.txt" doesn't work for redirecting input. [fixed]
 The rest looks great! no crashes. thanks for explaining it all.



echo ehllo > file1 < file2 >> file1  [fixed] = small if statement forgotten :(
then crtl+D, says exit. 			[done]
bash: cd/bin: No such file or directory so put all the headers into one folder [???? dont understand]





place comments to understand the code, for example, the input/output.
this is higher level coding. this way someone can read the header without having to read the code and still understand.
bash-3.2$ cd /bin/ls/ls/ls bash: cd: /bin/ls/ls/ls: Not a directory 
bash-3.2$ cdg /bin/ls/ls/ls 
bash: cdg: command not found 
echo hello < fole6 							[fixed]
echo "hello i am $HOME" HOMEBREW_TEMP      [nog testen op codam]
overall great work for a one man project. now ask the school if you can start cpp


SOME STUFF TO TAKE A LOOK:
ls | top, or anything before top 																		[Behaves the same as bash]
cat | cat | cat | ls                       																	[not doing that ;/]
Signals in heretic citric																					[fixed kindoff]				
Crtlc prints smth C																							[fixed]
Error code after cartel c on empty line																		[fixed]
ps aux doesn’t work at all																					[????? not sure why]
lsof -p process_id (file descriptors not used `anymore should be closed) -> depends on how you fork			[fixed fd leak]`



cd crashing mkdir a/b;cd  a/b; rm -rf ../../a; cd .. = segfault
